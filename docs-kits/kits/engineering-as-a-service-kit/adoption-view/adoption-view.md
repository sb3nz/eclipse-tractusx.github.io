## Vision & Mission

### Vision

A federated and interoperable engineering ecosystem where expertise, capabilities, and tools are accessible on-demand.  
Engineering as a Service (EaaS) revolutionizes the way engineering collaboration happens—by connecting distributed engineering competencies across organizations, enabling faster, more flexible, and trustworthy innovation.

### Mission

The mission of the **EaaS KIT** is to serve as the **ecosystem-facing brokerage and contracting layer** for engineering collaboration.  
EaaS connects engineering demand from the **Modular Engineering (ME)** layer with qualified providers in the Catena-X network — ensuring transparent, compliant, and efficient matchmaking.  

EaaS provides standardized semantics, interfaces, and processes for:
- Publishing and discovering engineering tasks and capabilities.  
- Matching demand with relevant providers.  
- Managing quotation, contracting, and access policy enforcement.  

By decoupling marketplace interaction from technical engineering execution, EaaS enables a **scalable, interoperable, and sovereign collaboration layer** that can prospecively support multiple domains and use cases beyond engineering.

---

## Business Value

Engineering as a Service brings substantial strategic and operational value to the Catena-X ecosystem and its participants through:

1. **Open Engineering Marketplace**  – Provides a federated marketplace for connecting engineering demand with specialized providers, expanding opportunities for SMEs.  
2. **Flexibility & Scalability** – Organizations can dynamically offer and/or access the engineering expertise they need, when they need it, avoiding underutilized resources and reducing time-to-market.
3. **Interoperability and Efficiency** – Establishes standardized interfaces and semantics for capability descriptions, quotations, and contracting. When automatomated, this reduces administrative overhead and accelerates engineering value creation.
4. **Specialization & Innovation** – SMEs and niche providers can expose unique competencies, increasing visibility and enabling targeted collaboration with OEMs and large enterprises.
5. **Operational Transparency** – Facilitates auditable and policy-compliant contracting while maintaining confidentiality of shared data.

---

### Summary of Business Benefits

**For Engineering Consumers:**
- On-demand access to a global network of engineering providers.
- Transparent, comparable, and verified engineering capabilities.
- Reduced effort for supplier scouting, quotation and contract handling.

**For Engineering Providers (SMEs, Specialized Teams):**
- Broader visibility and access to cross-domain projects.
- Opportunities to demonstrate verified skills and successful deliveries.
- Simplified, compliant and automatable contracting processes with minimal administrative effort.
- Better resource utilization and predictable workload.

**For the Ecosystem:**
- Increased innovation through interdisciplinary collaboration.
- Strengthened European engineering competitiveness.
- Accelerated digital transformation through standardization and interoperability.

## Use Case Context

### Industry Challenge

Engineering collaboration across organizations is often hampered by slow, manual, and opaque supplier selection and contracting processes. There is limited visibility into available capabilities and capacities, and no trusted digital marketplace for service negotiation. Organizations end up facing difficulties in identifying suitable engineering partners and managing complex contracts, often exhausting data security and sovereignty concepts throughout the process.

### The Solution

EaaS addresses these challenges by establishing a **federated engineering marketplace**. Companies can describe and publish their capabilities, discover qualified partners, and engage in trustworthy, data-sovereign collaborations.  
This creates a foundation for **engineering ecosystems** where value is co-created dynamically and efficiently.

---

## Use Cases

Defines the **minimum viable logic** for federated engineering service brokerage:
- Task publication and metadata ingestion from ME.  
- Capability discovery and matchmaking algorithms.  
- Quotation exchange and contract finalization.  
- Policy enforcement and logging for data sovereignty compliance.  

Deliverables: Process schema diagrams and workflow descriptions (under development).

---

## Business Processes

1. **Capability Identification & Publication** – Providers describe and publish their capabilities (and capacities) using standardized semantic models.
2. **Task Publication** – Tasks prepared in ME are published by potential consumers in the EaaS marketplace.  
3. **Capability Matching & Partner Discovery** – Consumers search for suitable partners based on technical and business criteria.
4. **Quotation** – Consumers request and providers submit offers according to standardized data formats.  
5. **Contract Negotiation & Agreement** – Selected providers finalize contracts; metadata is returned to [Modular Engineering](https://github.com/eclipse-tractusx/sig-release/issues/1553) for task execution.  
6. **Feedback Integration** – Provider ratings, performance data, and contractual outcomes are shared with ME and PPM for traceability and improvement. 

## Semantic Models

EaaS defines and utilizes semantic models to ensure interoperability and data sovereignty within engineering collaborations. Examples/suggestions are:

- **Engineering Capability Model** – Describes provider skills, competencies, and certifications.  
- **Task Publication Model** – Defines metadata for tasks published from ME for external fulfillment.  
- **Quotation and Contract Model** – Specifies semantics for offers, pricing, and contractual terms.  
- **Brokerage Interaction Model** – Captures negotiation states, contract references, and policy bindings.  

Deliverables: Semantic model documentation and links to the Tractus-X GitHub repository (to be provided).

## Functional Role and Ecosystem Integration  

EaaS acts as the **ecosystem interface layer** between Catena-X participants — facilitating trust-based engineering collaboration without handling the execution itself.

### 1. Relationship with Product Portfolio Management (PPM)
- PPM defines the overarching **product and process context**, which informs the scope of engineering tasks that may require external support.  
- EaaS uses PPM context metadata to ensure traceable linkage between marketplace activities and lifecycle governance. It obtains products and services (engineering processes) from the PPM-backbone and exposes them on the engineering marketplace.

### 2. Relationship with Modular Engineering (ME)
- ME defines and manages **modular tasks** and orchestrates engineering execution.  
- When additional capacity or expertise is needed, ME publishes these tasks to EaaS.  
- EaaS facilitates **discovery, negotiation, and contracting** — returning the selected provider and contract terms to ME for controlled task execution.  

### 3. Relationship with overall Data Sovereignty and Governance  
- EaaS relies on Catena-X’s **sovereign governance framework** and **usage policy enforcement mechanisms** to secure data transactions and ensure compliance.  
- Integrates with standardized **contract templates**, **usage policies**, and **audit logging** capabilities.  

### 4. Relationship with Other Domain KITs  
- As a horizontal service brokerage layer, EaaS can be extended to arbitrary use cases, such as manufacturing, logistics, or certification services -> XaaS.

## Standards

### Supported Standards

EaaS aligns with and contributes to Catena-X and IDSA standards for interoperability and data sovereignty.  The interconnection with existing standards and the scoping of additional standards are yet to be completed. Examples/suggestions are:

- **CX-ZYX:** Semantic Capability & Task Description (development not started).  
- **CX-XYZ:** Federated Contracting & Policy Enforcement (development not started).

## Tutorials & Resources

_To be developed for the “Graduated” stage._  
Tutorials will guide users through the process of:
- How to describe and publish engineering capabilities.  
- How to request, compare, and contract engineering services.  
- How to manage sovereign data exchange during contracting.  

Deliverables: Step-by-step documentation and video tutorial showcasing the EaaS onboarding and collaboration process.

### Whitepaper

A dedicated whitepaper could elaborate on: 

- The conceptual foundation of EaaS as a brokerage layer.  
- Semantic interoperability with PPM and ME.  
- Contracting and policy enforcement mechanisms.  
- Outlook: Future evolution toward AI-assisted capability discovery.  

As of now, no whitepaper on the topic of Engineering as a Service is planned.
