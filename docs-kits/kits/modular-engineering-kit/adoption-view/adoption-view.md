## Vision & Mission

### Vision

To enable a **modular and federated engineering ecosystem** where complex systems can be collaboratively developed by multiple partners – efficiently, transparently, and securely.  This empowers organizations to innovate faster, reuse proven solutions, and integrate interdisciplinary expertise across the Ecosystem.

### Mission

The **Modular Engineering KIT** establishes a common framework for modularized, data-sovereign product/system development.  

It provides standardized semantics and interface definitions that allow engineering activities (projects) to be modeled, distributed (utilizing [EaaS](https://github.com/eclipse-tractusx/sig-release/issues/1552)), and coordinated/executed across organizational boundaries. By structuring and interlinking engineering activities Modular Engineering ensures that every design, task, and decision is traceable and harmonized.

By doing so, ME becomes the operational runtime for engineering — the layer where conceptual designs, processes, and collaboration converge into tangible, traceable engineering results.lts.

## Business Value

Modular Engineering brings substantial strategic and operational value to the Catena-X ecosystem and its participants through:

1. **Federated Engineering Collaboration**  
   Complex development programs are structured into standardized $^1$, interoperable modules that can be orchestrated among the ecosystem participants. This takes into account scalability, alignment, and traceability across the entire engineering lifecycle.

2. **Requirement Alignment & Traceability**  
   Engineering objects and activities are (and consistently remain) connected to explicit requirements, enabling transparent validation, verification, and compliance tracking.

3. **Process Efficiency & Modularity**  
   Standardized process patterns and reusable engineering modules reduce redundant work, shorten development cycles, and improve overall quality.

4. **Ecosystem Scalability & Resilience**  
   Modular Engineering supports a scalable collaboration model that allows quick partner onboarding, dynamic resource allocation, and flexible reconfiguration of engineering networks in response to market demands.

5. **Data Sovereignty & Intellectual Property Protection**  
   Through Catena-X dataspace principles, partners retain full control over their engineering data and models while enabling the selective, trusted exchange of information.

6. **Outlook: Foundation for AI-Enhanced Engineering**  
   Standardized structures and data interoperability form the foundation for advanced analytics and AI-assisted decision-making in engineering workflows.

## Use Case Context

### Industry Challenge

Modern product development increasingly depends on distributed, multidisciplinary teams working across different organizations and digital environments. However, current engineering practices are often siloed, with inconsistent data formats, redundant tasks, and limited process/workflow visibility. The lack of modularization makes scaling and collaboration inefficient, especially for specialized SMEs.  

Without a standardized foundation for project breakdown, interface definition, and lifecycle control, cross-company development efforts are prone to misalignment, delays, and costly integration issues.

### The Solution

Modular Engineering establishes a **unified method for structuring, managing, and integrating engineering activities** across company boundaries. It provides:
- A **common semantic foundation** for project scoping and orchestration for all engineering stakeholders.
- A **modular project architecture** that enables the decomposition of complexity into manageable, interoperable elements.
- A **trusted collaboration space** that respects data sovereignty and intellectual property.

This enables the orchestration of **federated development ecosystems**, where each participant contributes specialized expertise while maintaining full control

## Business Processes

1. **Requirements Definition** – A development (with demand for modular engineering acitivities) is initialized by a set of requirements.
1. **System Decomposition** – A complex system (subject of development that meets the requirements) is divided into a modular set of objects (subsystems) for collaborative engineering.
2. **Project modeling** – Each object is linked to corresponding engineering activities and phases.
3. **Interface Specification** – Define clear data, model, and process interfaces between modules.
5. **Concurrent Development** – Execute modular engineering tasks while maintaining consistency through synchronization of product and process representations.
6. **Integration & Validation** – Merge subsystem results and validate against defined interfaces and requirements.
7. **Version Control & Feedback** – Manage iterative updates and improvements through traceable versioning.:

## Semantic Models

Modular Engineering complies to/defines several semantic models. Suggestions/examples are:

- **Bill of Engineering Processes (BoE)** – The BoE data model defines a set of mandatory properties to provide information about the engineering process and enables the common understanding required for engineering task orchestration.
- **Engineering Satus Tracking** – Get status information about engineering tasks to enable tracking of progress & task management.
- **Bill of Requirements** – Represets the functional and non-funtional requirements towars the product and its engineering process.

Deliverables: Jointly refined model specifications and GitHub repository links.

## Functional Role and Ecosystem Integration  

Modular Engineering acts as a **collaboration orchestration KIT** within the Tractus-X engineering ecosystem, providing the framework for federated, collaborative development. Its functionalities are designed to connect and synergize with other Tractus-X KITs, creating an integrated engineering value chain:

### 1. Connection with Product Portfolio Management (PPM)
- **Modular Engineering** builds and orchestrates concrete engineering procedures (HOW) based on the elements (processes & products) provided by **PPM** (WHAT).  
- More percise: A modular development is composed of a set of engineering activities (processes/tasks) and corresponding objects (products/sub-systems) that are instantiated under a PPM-managed lifecycle. In Modular Engineering, they are selected, combined and orchestrated in a way so they meet concrete **requirements**.
- Feedback on progress, design maturity, and engineering performance is continuously reported back to PPM.

### 2. Connection with Engineering as a Service (EaaS)
- **Modular Engineering** defines *what* is to be done (tasks, interfaces, modular objects), while **EaaS** defines *who* performs it.  
- The EaaS KIT leverages Modular Engineering’s task definitions to identify, match, and contract suitable partners/service providers. The results are fed back into ME’s execution environment and utilized within the project context.

### 3. Relationship with overall Data Sovereignty and Governance
- Modular Engineering builds on the Catena-X principles of **data sovereignty** and **usage policy enforcement**, ensuring that engineering data shared between partners adheres to defined access rights and contractual terms.

### 4. Alignment with Digital Twin and Product Lifecycle KITs
- Modular Engineering utilizes **Digital Twin frameworks** to represent structured engineering information (requirements, process & product data etc.) - of course.
- The KIT complements lifecycle management by linking design data with manufacturing and operational twins, ensuring traceability across the product’s lifecycle.

## Standards

### Supported Standards

ME aligns with and contributes to Catena-X and IDSA standards for interoperability and data sovereignty. The interconnection with existing standards and the scoping of additional standards are yet to be completed.

## Tutorials & Resources

_To be developed for the “Graduated” stage._  
Tutorials can demonstrate:
- How to define requirements and link them to a set of development objects and processes.
- How to model and manage relationships and dependencies between components and activities.
- How to define, assign, and execute modular tasks.

Currently, the creation of tutorial content is not planned.

### Whitepaper

A **Modular Engineering Whitepaper** could elaborate on:
- The conceptual foundations of modularized engineering within Catena-X.
- The architecture and lifecycle of Virtual Development Objects.
- Governance models for federated engineering networks.
- Semantic standards supporting interoperability and lifecycle traceability.

Currently, the creation of a whitepaper is not planned.
