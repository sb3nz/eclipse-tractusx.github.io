## Eclipse Tractus-X Partners with the Eclipse Dataspace Working Group

**Madrid, Spain | Dataspace Symposium 2026** – We are thrilled to announce a significant milestone for Eclipse Tractus-X at the **Dataspace Symposium 2026** (February 10-11, 2026, in Madrid, Spain): **our project has officially partnered with the Eclipse Dataspace Working Group (EDWG)**!

Following a successful vote among the committee and project leads, Eclipse Tractus-X has been included under the purview of the Eclipse Dataspace Working Group. This partnership marks a pivotal moment in our journey and sends a clear signal: **Eclipse Tractus-X is more ready than ever to drive the adoption of future dataspace solutions and accelerate dataspace development**.

Making this announcement at the Dataspace Symposium—bringing together industry leaders, innovators, and standardization experts from around the world—underscores the international significance of this partnership and our shared commitment to advancing the dataspace ecosystem.

## What Does This Collaboration Mean?

Think of this partnership like a marriage—a strategic alliance where both the Eclipse Dataspace Working Group and Eclipse Tractus-X commit to pushing each other forward. Together, we're strengthening the foundation for interoperable, standardized dataspaces that will transform industries worldwide.

Through this collaboration, Eclipse Tractus-X pledges to:

- **Continue adopting and implementing** the most important dataspace standards (DSP & DCP) and specifications developed by the EDWG
- **Drive real-world adoption** of these standards through our open-source implementations
- **Provide feedback and insights** from production deployments to inform future specifications
- **Accelerate innovation & adoption** in dataspace technologies through shared expertise and resources

## Our Commitment to Open Source Dataspace Standards

It's no secret that Eclipse Tractus-X has been at the forefront of implementing key open source dataspace protocols written by the Eclipse Dataspace Working Group:

- **The Dataspace Protocol (DSP)** - already deeply integrated into our technology stack
- **The Decentralized Claims Protocol (DCP)** - actively adopted and utilized across our implementations

The announcement at this prestigious event underscores the importance of this partnership and our shared commitment to advancing the dataspace ecosystem on an international scale. And as a project under the governance of the eclipse foundation, we are committed to continue to push the adoption of open standards developed at our foundation.

## What is not happening now

- **Eclipse Tractus-X remains sovereign** as a project under the Eclipse Foundation Governance as always and has the total freedom to choose its roadmap, features, which additional protocols to adopt and scope.
- **The EDWG has no "governance" over Eclipse Tractus-X** - The collaboration is a mutual agreement between Eclipse Tractus-X and the Eclipse Dataspace Working Group (EDWG), which can be finalized at anytime, however by having this partnership both parties can benefit from this agreement. The "governance" over Eclipse Tractus-X continues to be the rules from the Eclipse Foundation and the TRGs (Tractus-X Release Guidelines) which are the rules of the Eclipse Tractus-X project.

## Looking Ahead

This partnership represents more than just organizational alignment—it's a commitment to the future of dataspaces. By combining the EDWG's expertise in standardization with Eclipse Tractus-X's proven track record in implementation and pushing adoption, we're creating a powerful feedback loop that benefits the entire dataspace ecosystem.

We're excited to deepen our collaboration with the Eclipse Dataspace Working Group and invite the broader community to join us on this journey. Together, we're building the foundation for secure, sovereign, and interoperable data exchange that will power the digital economy of tomorrow.

Stay tuned for more updates as this partnership unfolds!

## Join Us at the Symposium

We're proud to be present at the **Eclipse Dataspace Working Group booth** throughout the Dataspace Symposium 2026, representing Eclipse Tractus-X and engaging with the community. Stop by to meet our project leads Mikel Garcia (LKS Next) and Mathias Moser (Catena-X), discuss the partnership, and explore how we're working together with multiple industry players to shape the future of dataspaces. We look forward to connecting with you!
